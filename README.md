# IMDB_Sentiment_Analysis
Given the massive volume of online review data (Amazon, IMDB, etc.), sentiment analysis becomes increasingly important. In this project, a sentiment classifier is built which evaluates the polarity of a section of text being either positive or negative. Sentiment Analysis is done on IMDB Dataset that comes bundled with Keras. It consists of 25,000 training samples (of which 20% are validation) and 25,000 test samples. All words in the dataset are pre-tokenized. Self-trained word embeddings are used (the Keras Embedding layer). I've trained different models, one contains a single LSTM layer. It gives 84% accuracy on 10 epochs. The second example consists of 2 sets of Conv1D and MaxPooling1D layers followed by standard GRU layer. 85% accuracy is observed. I've used CuDNN layers for LSTM and GRU as they are much faster on GPU than standard LSTM and GRU layers.  All implementations are made using Keras. Another example with RMS Prop accuracy was 84% and with Adam Optimizer it was observed to be 87%.
